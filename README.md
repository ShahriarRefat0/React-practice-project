# React Practice Projects ⚛️

Welcome to my React Practice Projects repository!

This repo contains small projects and components that I’m building to strengthen my skills in **React.js** as part of my web development learning journey.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- Beginner-friendly React mini-projects
- Functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Props and state management
- Reusable and clean UI components
- Projects built during my **6-month coding challenge**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React.js (with Vite or Create React App)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- JSX
- CSS / Tailwind (depending on the project)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository helps me:
- Practice React concepts hands-on
- Build clean and reusable components
- Understand component structure and lifecycle
- Prepare for real-world React projects and job interviews

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Each folder inside the repo is a standalone project.  
To run any project:

```bash
cd project-folder-name
npm install
npm run dev   # or npm start for CRA projects



---

You can now paste this directly into your `README.md` file.

Would you like a matching **project idea list** or help writing individual `README`s inside each project folder?

Let me know!
